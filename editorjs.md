# Introduction #

Online web text-editor
Features

  * bold;
  * italic;
  * underline;
  * alignment (center, left, right);
  * Font face (Arial, Times, Verdana, Courier New, Comic Sans MS);
  * Font size;
  * Font color;
  * Header and footer (for PDF generation)

Very simple and useful editor, it needs to be improved a lot, but it works for basic text-formatting.
I've developed it for creation of e-mail and letter templates by users, nothing so sophisticated.
Works in all browsers.
