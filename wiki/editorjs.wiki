Very simple and useful editor, it needs to be improved a lot, but it works for basic text-formatting.
I've developed it for creation of e-mail and letter templates by users, nothing so sophisticated.
Works on IE (6.0 or >) and Mozilla Firefox. On IE, it uses an native API to apply text-formatting and in Firefox it uses DOM manipulation.
